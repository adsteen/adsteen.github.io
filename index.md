# Overview

We're in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. We're trying to understand how organic carbon gets oxidized in aquatic environments. Since heterotrophic microorganisms play a big role in this, we spend a lot of time thinking about the extracellular enzymes that microorganisms use to break down complex organic carbon. Lately we've been working on novel abiotic mechanisms that may be responsible for organic carbon oxidation, too.

# Environments

## The Deep Marine Subsurface

## Estuaries and the Coastal Ocean

## Mountain Rivers, Lakes and Streams
