# Activities of extracellular enzymes in deep marine sediments

Deep marine sediments contain active microbial communities, but these microorganisms live *extremely* slow lifestyles. Surprisingly, many of these microorganisms are heterotrophs. We're trying to understand how these organisms get their food. Based on our work, they produce extracellular enzymes to metabolize complex substrates, in similar fashion to [active communities in surface sediments, seawater, and soils](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-013-9906-5). We're trying to understand:

* What specific enzymes do subsurface microbial communities produce?
* What happens to those enzymes once they are produced, and how do they interact with the extracellular environment?
* What are the limits of extracellular enzyme production as a viable metabolic strategy?
