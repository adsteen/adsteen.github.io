# Expectations for all lab members

## Safety

**Everyone who steps into lab is responsible for lab safety.**

### Behavior

* **If you see an unsafe practice, speak up.** This means talking to anyone involved in an unsafe situation immediately, and telling Drew as soon as is practical. Drew's cell phone number is on the lab whiteboard; don't be afraid to use it.
* Look after your own mental and physical health. Eat well, get enough sleep, and get some regular exercise. It is difficult to stay safe if your [basic needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) are not being met.

### Clothing

* At all times, long pants and closed-toe shoes must be worn in lab. 
* Safety glasses and lab coats must be worn when anyone in lab is working with 


### Training

* All lab members must take the UT Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) basic lab safety training class as soon as possible.
* All lab members must be trained to use any instrument before using it. For now, this training is mostly informal - but ask an experienced lab member before you use anything in lab that you haven't used before.

### Resources

* [UT EHS](https://ehs.utk.edu/)
* [UT Student Health](http://studenthealth.utk.edu/)
    * [Student Health Appointment Scheduling](http://studenthealth.utk.edu/online-schedulingstudent-health-portal/)
    * [Counseling center](http://studenthealth.utk.edu/online-schedulingstudent-health-portal/)
* In an emergency, call 911.

## Data processing and storage

* **All measurements must be calibrated at the time of measurement.**
* All handwritten data must be recorded immediately and stored in lab notebooks.
* All computer data and plots must be stored on the SteenLab dropbox site.
* The data analysis language of choice is R, but this is a recommendation rather than a requirement. 
    * Excel worksheets should follow Karl Broman's recommendations [here](http://kbroman.org/dataorg/)
    * R code should observe [Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) style guide.

### Lab notebooks

* Record everything you do in a lab notebook, as you do it.
* Each day's work should be recorded on a new page, with full date, title, and a brief explanation of the day's task.
* Relevant data should be graphed by hand in the lab notebook, or a plot of data should be printed and taped into the lab notebook.

# The Principle Investigator (Drew)

* Provide leadership for the scientific direction of the lab.
* Obtain funding for supplies, field work, and instruments.
* Assist students to write papers about their research, for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
* Assist students to identify meetings at which to present their research, and assist students to create presentation materials.
* Attempt to secure external funding for graduate students.
* Meet weekly with students to assess progress and plan the next week.

# Students

## All students

* Meet with Drew once a week (travel permitting)
* Notify Drew if you won't be in during your normal hours.

## Graduate students

* Take responsibility for your project. Drew is the pit crew chief; you're driving the car.
* Read approximately 5 papers per week.
* Ph.D. students should seek their own funding at all levels (full graduate fellowships all the way through small-dollar grants for travel or supplies).
* Attend weekly lab meeting
* Typically be at work from 9 am - 5 pm. We don't punch a clock, but all lab members should recognize a similar schedule.
* Mentor one undergraduate student at a time.

## Undergraduate students

* Read at least 1 paper per week.
* Attend weekly lab meeting (class schedule permitting)
* Be in lab at least 10 hours / week on a set schedule. Sign in and out. It is OK to miss scheduled lab times when your academic workload is high (e.g. exam time) but be sure to notify Drew.
* Do not make major changes to experimental plans or procedures without checking with Drew or your graduate mentor.
