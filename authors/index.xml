      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abby joined the lab in 2016 and studied the distribution of peptidases in small freshwater bodies in East Tennessee, as well as in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania. Abby also worked with high school students as part of the Malcolm X Shabazz High School Aquatic Geochemistry Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, Abby went to work as an environmental consultant with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.westonandsampson.com/&#34;&gt;Weston and Sampson&lt;/a&gt;, and now works as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy looking at water contaminants and it’s interaction with rocks and life around (biogeochemistry). I also like exploring the relationship between climate cycles and biogeochemistry. In summary, biogeochemistry as it pertains to water, soil, and climate!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris graduated from the Steen Lab in 2020. After working on a project related to microbial degradation of microcystin, he developed a passion for data science. He combined the two projects to produce an R package, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ezmmek/index.html&#34;&gt;ezmmek&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and standardize the calculation of enzyme kinetics in environmental samples using chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates. He now works at the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in studying how various chemical species behave on a molecular scale in water-rock-soil-life systems (environmental geochemistry). I also enjoy looking into employing isotopic tracers as a way to understand paleoocean environments. Broadly, I seek to understand and model what chemical behaviors have measurable impacts from a geological standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lauren earned her Ph.D. in Microbiology at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/buchanlab/home&#34;&gt;Dr. Alison Buchan’s lab&lt;/a&gt;, with Dr. Steen as a co-advisor. Her dissertation focused on microbial degradation of plant-derived carbon in the salt marshes of the southeastern United States. Since graduating in 2018, she completed a postdoctoral appointment at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forsyth.org&#34;&gt;Forsyth Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Boston where she studied how microbial interactions in the nasal microbiome influence Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Lauren is currently the research scientist at &lt;a href=&#34;https://1cell-bio.com/&#34;&gt;1CellBio&lt;/a&gt; where she works to develop and adapt &amp;lsquo;omics techniques to work in droplets on a single-cell scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy investigating microbial communities and how they impact the global climate cycle. In my free time, I like to go white water rafting and running with my dog, Naomi. I am still very early in my academic career, so I am always trying to learn as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2016 with a BS in Geology and Environmental Studies and from Vermont Law School with a Juris Doctor degree in 2020. I am interested in the fields of Natural Resource Management, specifically concerning water availability issues. My second passion is education and assisting post-secondary institutions to provide the best quality education and services to the students that attend them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started working in the Steen lab in the spring of 2021 after working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://bcmb.utk.edu/people/faculty/tongye-shen/&#34;&gt;Dr. Tongye Shen&lt;/a&gt; on protein ligand binding. I am now studying the extent to which extracellular glycosylases expressed by microbes in the ocean rely on carbohydrate binding modules, in order to better understand the marine cycle of dissolved organic carbon. I plan to attend dental school after receiving my undergraduate degree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing her PhD in UC Berkeley’s Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department. She graduated with her BS in Chemical Engineering from Brown University in 2016. In the summer of 2015, Rebecca worked with Dr. Steen in studying bioavailability of nutrients to extracellular enzymes in deep subsurface sediments. Her current research in Markita Landry’s lab focuses on designing fluorescent carbon nanomaterial-based sensors to probe biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taylor is interested in using data science approaches to better understand the distribution of microbial functions across phylogeny and space. After earning a Ph.D. in Geology from UT-Knoxville in three years, he moved to a position as a post-doc in the Steen Lab, where he used using data science tools to better understand the structure and function of microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor is now a scientist at &lt;a href=&#34;https://somalogic.com/&#34;&gt;SomaLogic&lt;/a&gt; working on designing aptamers.&lt;/p&gt;
