      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris graduated from the Steen Lab in 2020. After working on a project related to microbial degradation of microcystin, he developed a passion for data science. He combined the two projects to produce an R package, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ezmmek/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ezmmek&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and standardize the calculation of enzyme kinetics using chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates in environmetnal samples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lauren was in the Steen lab from 2014 to 2020, during which time she worked as an undergraduate researcher, lab manager, and graduate student. After completing a master&amp;rsquo;s thesis on enzyme activities in contrasting temperate and Arctic estuarine sediments, she has taken a job at &lt;a href=&#34;https://microbe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microbial Insights&lt;/a&gt;, a Knoxville consulting firm that provides a diverse range of services related to environmental microbiology, including environmental remediation, environmental forensics, microbiologically-influenced corrosion and microbial source tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lauren earned her Ph.D. in Microbiology at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/buchanlab/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Alison Buchan’s lab&lt;/a&gt;, with Dr. Steen as a co-advisor. Her dissertation focused on microbial degradation of plant-derived carbon in the salt marshes of the southeastern United States. Since graduating in 2018, she completed a postdoctoral appointment at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forsyth.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Forsyth Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Boston where she studied how microbial interactions in the nasal microbiome influence Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Lauren is currently the research scientist at &lt;a href=&#34;https://1cell-bio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1CellBio&lt;/a&gt; where she works to develop and adapt &amp;lsquo;omics techniques to work in droplets on a single-cell scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2016 with a BS in Geology and Environmental Studies. I am in the process of getting a Juris Doctor Degree from Vermont Law School with a graduation date of May 16, 2020. My goal is to take the Bar Exam in July of the same year. I am interested in the fields of Natural Resource Management, specifically concerning water availability issues. My second passion is education and assisting post-secondary institutions to provide the best quality education and services to the students that attend them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing her PhD in UC Berkeley’s Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department. She graduated with her BS in Chemical Engineering from Brown University in 2016. In the summer of 2015, Rebecca worked with Dr. Steen in studying bioavailability of nutrients to extracellular enzymes in deep subsurface sediments. Her current research in Markita Landry’s lab focuses on designing fluorescent carbon nanomaterial-based sensors to probe biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zach has been with the lab since 2017, during which time he has investigated the priming effect in Tennessee waterways near Knoxville, TN. Zach is also working on a project exploring the role of factors like extracellular enzyme activities, sediment grain size, mineralogy, and manganese speciation on the preservation of proteinaceous organic matter in sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC.&lt;/p&gt;
