      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lauren earned her Ph.D. in Microbiology at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/buchanlab/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Alison Buchanâ€™s lab&lt;/a&gt;, with Dr. Steen as a co-advisor. Her dissertation focused on microbial degradation of plant-derived carbon in the salt marshes of the southeastern United States. Since graduating in 2018, she completed a postdoctoral appointment at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forsyth.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Forsyth Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Boston where she studied how microbial interactions in the nasal microbiome influence Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Lauren is currently the research scientist at &lt;a href=&#34;https://1cell-bio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1CellBio&lt;/a&gt; where she works to develop and adapt &amp;lsquo;omics techniques to work in droplets on a single-cell scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2016 with a BS in Geology and Environmental Studies. I am in the process of getting a Juris Doctor Degree from Vermont Law School with a graduation date of May 16, 2020. My goal is to take the Bar Exam in July of the same year. I am interested in the fields of Natural Resource Management, specifically concerning water availability issues. My second passion is education and assisting post-secondary institutions to provide the best quality education and services to the students that attend them.&lt;/p&gt;
