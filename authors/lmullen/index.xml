      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is a special one: it is our first paper out of the Malcolm X Shabazz Aquatic Geochemistry Team project. More than 60 studens from Malcolm X Shabazz High School contributed to the data collection effort, and all of them are named individually in the paper. Kim Boerrigter, who acted as a student leader of the team, earned individual authorship. Since publication, more than 40 additional students have taken part in the Team, and we continue to produce research and work towards a second publication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lauren was in the Steen lab from 2014 to 2020, during which time she worked as an undergraduate researcher, lab manager, and graduate student. After completing a master&amp;rsquo;s thesis on enzyme activities in contrasting temperate and Arctic estuarine sediments, she has taken a job at &lt;a href=&#34;https://microbe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microbial Insights&lt;/a&gt;, a Knoxville consulting firm that provides a diverse range of services related to environmental microbiology, including environmental remediation, environmental forensics, microbiologically-influenced corrosion and microbial source tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
